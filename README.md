# dog cat classifier
## What is it?
Dog cat classifier distinguishes whether the image is a cat or dog.
## How does it work?
Using tensorflow, different features of each animal are saved into a model, which is then used for predictions.
## How do I set this up?
1. create a ``train`` folder and then a ``cats`` and ``dogs`` folder within it. 
2. Place all cat and dog images inside their respective folders. 
3. Open and run the classifier.py file and wait for it to complete training the model.
4. Open and run predict.py, input your image path and let it predict whether it is a dog or cat!
## Can I use this work?
